    <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 150. Mostly because I liked how it showed  me how to use my knowledge to create mathematical models with an emphasis on its applications.</p>

    <p>I loved KAS 1 (Kasaysayan ng Pilipinas) because I have always been interested in history and it provided me an insight into our cultures of origin as well as cultures with which I am less familiar. </p>

    <p>My favorite programming language is Python because I think it is very readable, beginner-friendly, flexible and is an excellent way to quickly write personal programs.</p>
